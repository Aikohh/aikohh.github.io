# Introduction

Waker wields a Harmonizer and uses the power of friendship and bonds with entities known as Familiars to defeat foes.

Waker is one of the highest actions-per-minute (APM) classes in the game, requiring many fast button presses to play optimally especially against aggressive enemies like Ikusa Bujin (found in Geometric Labyrinth). Not only that, but every action has to be carefully timed due to unforgiving animation locks.

Knowing your enemy's attack pattern is half the battle.
