# Introduction

Waker wields a Harmonizer and uses the power of friendship and bonds with entities known as Familiars to defeat foes.

Waker is one of the highest actions-per-minute (APM) classes in the game, requiring many fast button presses to play optimally especially against aggressive enemies like Ikusa Bujin (found in Geometric Labyrinth).
