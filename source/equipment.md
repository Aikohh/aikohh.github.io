# Equipment 

You can't be a good Waker without at least some half-decent equipment. Here are some recommendations.

## Harmonizers

These are the only current weapon series I can recommend using:

```{csv-table}
---
header: >
  "Weapon Series", "Level Req.", "Attack", "Potential", "Notes"
widths: 15, 5, 5, 20, 30
align: center
---

"![weapon](_static/weapon/64px-NGSUIItemNeosAstraeanHarmonizer.png) \
Neos Astraean", "Lv.70", "761", "Potency +38%; Photon Blast Gauge Charge when attacking +25%; PP Consumption Reduced 15% for 90 seconds after using Photon Blast.", "This is the best weapon series. It drops from Dark Falz Aegis in The Battle of Halphia Lake Urgent Quest. Although getting one with a good [Preset Skill](#weapon-preset-skills) will be difficult, it is still generally the best option available even without a fixa."

"![weapon](_static/weapon/64px-NGSUIItemCrystiaHarmonizer.png) \
Crystia", "Lv.55", "721", "Potency +42%; PP +6 when you defeat nearby enemies.", "The Crystia series is a great weapon to use for mobbing when you are not using the Force subclass. Due to its utility, it is good to keep in your arsenal even after obtaining a Neos Astraean, thus making it also a good intermediate weapon to invest into while working towards a Neos Astraean"

```

(weapon-preset-skills)=
### Preset Skills

The recommended Preset Skill for weapons is **Fatale** for higher crit rates to mitigate [weapon damage variance](https://pso2na.arks-visiphone.com/wiki/Portal:New_Genesis/Damage_Calculation#Weapon_Variance).
See the [NGS Damage Calculator](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/195u5PhyZNLBWO0kkR7ebbcf9XARvtBS9eJbSRkiAyIk/edit?usp=sharing) to compare the damage outputs of various Weapon Series and Preset Skills.

### Multiweapon

Multiweaponing the Harmonizer is not necessary, as it is a self-sufficient weapon that can already do everything on its own.
It has no issues with managing PP, and it already has the best mobility in the game (both vertically and horizontally) which makes a multiweapon with a PP-restoring or mobility-aiding weapon redundant.

## Armor

```{csv-table}
---
header: >
  "Armor Name", "Level Req.", "Defense", "Properties", "Notes"
widths: 15, 5, 5, 20, 30
align: center
---

"![armor](_static/armor/64px-NGSUIItemEclaireurArmor.png) \
Eclaireur Armor", "Lv.65", "96", "![satk](_static/stat/NGSUIStatSATK.png) +4.0% \
![ratk](_static/stat/NGSUIStatRATK.png) +4.0% \
![tatk](_static/stat/NGSUIStatTATK.png) +4.0% \
DMG Resist -5.0%", "This is the best armor for maximizing your damage output, but it comes at the cost of survivability and PP. Even so, Waker has no troubles managing PP, and has some skills that help with survivability to make up for the lack of HP and counteract the negative damage resist such as [Retro Friends Rescue](#retro-friends-rescue) and [Welfare Management](#welfare-management)"

"![armor](_static/armor/64px-NGSUIItemAjaxArmor.png) \
Ajax Armor", "Lv.70", "102", "HP +30 \
PP +5 \
![satk](_static/stat/NGSUIStatSATK.png) +3.5% \
![ratk](_static/stat/NGSUIStatRATK.png) +3.5% \
![tatk](_static/stat/NGSUIStatTATK.png) +3.5% \
DMG Resist +1.0%", "This is the best armor for casual players looking for some extra survivability. It boasts good damage characteristics in addition to PP with all its HP, defense, and Damage Resist stats"

"![armor](_static/armor/64px-NGSUIItemEfitusArmorSheza.png) \
Efitus Armor: Sheza", "Lv.57", "100", "HP +30 \
PP +4 \
![satk](_static/stat/NGSUIStatSATK.png) +3.0% \
![tatk](_static/stat/NGSUIStatTATK.png) +3.0%", "This is the best budget armor since it has decent damage stats, good survivability, and also **comes with the Mastery IV augment** on it (assuming you get it from a [Red Box](https://twitter.com/maka_ngs/status/1600551086720311296) or bought one from the Personal Shop with Mastery IV on it). You can stick with this armor until you can afford to upgrade to Ajax or Eclaireur"

"![armor](_static/armor/64px-NGSUIItemEfitusArmorBelta.png) \
Efitus Armor: Belta", "Lv.57", "100", "HP +30 \
PP +4 \
![ratk](_static/stat/NGSUIStatRATK.png) +3.0% \
![tatk](_static/stat/NGSUIStatTATK.png) +3.0%", "This is the best budget armor since it has decent damage stats, good survivability, and also **comes with the Mastery IV augment** on it (assuming you get it from a [Red Box](https://twitter.com/maka_ngs/status/1600551086720311296) or bought one from the Personal Shop with Mastery IV on it). You can stick with this armor until you can afford to upgrade to Ajax or Eclaireur"
```

### Preset Skills

Preset Skills on armors are not necessary (especially given Waker's excellent PP economy) but **Performa** and high level **Enthusia** Preset Skills are considered the best. Performa is preferred over Enthusia.

## Augments

Augmenting weapons and armor is rather straight-forward.
The Harmonizer is a Technique weapon and therefore scales off of Technique Weapon Potency.
Use augments with the highest Potency you can get, and secondarily maximize Potency Floor to raise your average DPS due to [weapon damage variance](https://pso2na.arks-visiphone.com/wiki/Portal:New_Genesis/Damage_Calculation#Weapon_Variance).

For non-potency stats such as HP, PP, Damage Resistance, it is up to you how much you value them based on your skill level and playstyle. Non-potency stats are ignored in the ranking below.

Here are all the current top augments ranked from best to worst:

```{csv-table}
---
header: >
  "Rank", "Augments", "Potency"
widths: 5, 20, 20
align: center
---

"1", "Halphinale", "+4.0% Potency"

"2", "Addi Deftmeltech \
Addi Deftratech", "+3.0% Potency \
+2.75% Potency Floor"

"3", "Mastery IV \
Alts Secreta IV", "+2.5% Potency \
+2.5% Potency Floor"

"4", "Addi Spimeltech \
Addi Spiratech \
Addi Stameltech \
Addi Staratech \
Addi Guameltech \
Addi Guaratech \
Addi Wardmeltech \
Addi Wardratech", "+3.0% Potency \
+1.0% Potency Floor"

"5", "Nils Soul IV \
Nex Soul IV \
Ams Soul IV \
Aegis Soul IV \
Renus Soul IV \
Gigas Technique IV \
Technique IV \
Stira Domina", "+3.0% Potency"

"6", "Meltech Dualble IV \
Ratech Dualble IV", "+2.75% Potency"
```

The above list contains both cheap and expensive augments, so just go down the list and get what you can afford given your own budget. Example builds:

Minmax (most expensive)
> Halphinale \
> Addi Deftratech \
> Mastery IV \
> Alts Secreta IV \
> Nils Soul IV

Budget (cheapest)
> Alts Secreta IV \
> Nils Soul IV \
> Technique IV \
> Stira Domina \
> Meltech Dualble IV

```{note}
Augments not mentioned above are not to be considered and should be replaced as soon as possible.
However, even worse would be to have empty augment slots because Potency stacks multiplicatively and you will be losing out on even more damage by having empty augment slots.
