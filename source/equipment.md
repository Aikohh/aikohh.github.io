## Weapons, Armor, Augments

Since best-in-slot gear has very little variation between classes (aside from Slayer), it doesn't make much sense to include it in a class-specific guide.
For gearing suggestions such as the best weapon and armor series, as well as the best augments to use, refer to

## Multiweapon Choice

Multiweaponing the Harmonizer is not necessary, as it is a versatile weapon that can already do everything on its own.
It has no issues with managing PP, and it already has the best mobility in the game (both vertically and horizontally) which makes a multiweapon with a PP-restoring or mobility-aiding weapon redundant.
Attempting to use another weapon for damage will mean you stop gaining familiar focus to use more familiar harmonies.
