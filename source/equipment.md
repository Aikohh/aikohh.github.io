# Equipment 

Waker wields a Harmonizer

## Weapons

Neos Astrean with Fatale 5 is the best Harmonizer in the game

### Multiweapon

Multiweaponing the Harmonizer is not necessary, as it is a weapon that can already do just about anything.
If you are igniting your Treble Clefs often enough (as you should be), then maintaining a healthy amount of PP should be no problem and thus multiweapon choices such as the Talis or Launcher are unecessary for additional PP regeneration.

## Units

Eclairer armor is the best, followed by Ajax and then Efitus

## Augments

Halphinale is the best ale
