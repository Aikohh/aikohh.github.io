### ![wa](_static/class/UINGSClassWa.png) ![sub](_static/class/UINGSClassSl.png) Waker/Slayer
Slayer is a great general-purpose subclass, providing 3% additional crit rate from Critical Up, and an additional 2% crit rate against bosses from Gallant Attack Critical up.
Having this extra crit rate is especially useful for Waker due to how much of its damage comes from single-hit bursts such as [Familiar Harmony](#familiar-harmony) and [Marmelo Strike](#marmelo-strike) that you want to have crit as much as possible.
Slayer's Critical Hit PP Gain also helps with PP sustain especially during mobbing scenarios in which you can hit multiple enemies at the same time to maximize the chances of it restoring PP every second.
However, the Force subclass is still vastly superior for PP sustain in mobbing situations.

### ![wa](_static/class/UINGSClassWa.png) ![sub](_static/class/UINGSClassFo.png) Waker/Force
Force is the best subclass for mobbing thanks to Eradication PP Gain which restores PP for each nearby enemy defeated.
It is not as useful for bossing, but it does still help by providing increased natural PP recovery (from PP Recovery Boost) and the ability to very quickly restore PP using the PP Conversion skill at the cost of some HP.
PP Conversion allows you to spam [Photon Arts](#photon-arts) in niche scenarios where you wouldn't otherwise be able to sustain it (such as in the finale of The Battle of Halphia Lake).
The Rod and Talis can also be used to cast Techniques to apply Elemental Down and be used for dealing with mechanics of certain enemies such as Nils.

### ![wa](_static/class/UINGSClassWa.png) ![sub](_static/class/UINGSClassBo.png) Waker/Bouncer
If the enemies you are fighting have breakable parts, or you need to get downs quickly, then the Bouncer subclass is your go-to.
Partial Destroy Advantage increases the damage you deal by 1% for each part broken on an enemy (and also reduces damage taken by 2%). This stacks up to 3 times!
Defeat Amplifier increases Physical and Elemental Down Factor by 15%, allowing you to get faster downs.
You also get access to Jet Boots which can be used to cast Techniques for applying Elemental Down and dealing with mechanics of certain enemies such as Nils.

### ![wa](_static/class/UINGSClassWa.png) ![sub](_static/class/UINGSClassFi.png) Waker/Fighter
Increases damage dealt and active PP regeneration on downed enemies thanks to Defeat Advantage and Defeat PP Recovery, making it great to use for bossing.
Do note, however, that this only applies to Physical and Elemental downs. Defeat Advantage and Defeat PP Recovery do not apply during Breaks or special downs that occur from breaking specific parts of some enemies.

### ![wa](_static/class/UINGSClassWa.png) ![sub](_static/class/UINGSClassTe.png) Waker/Techter
Increases [Photon Blast](#photon-blast) accumulation rate by 20% when you are near a boss thanks to Awake Aile.
Weak Element Amplifier further boosts Photon Blast accumulation rate by 20% if your attacks' element matches the elemental weakness of your enemies, which applies when using an elemental [weapon](#harmonizers).
Techter subclass is great for bossing because it allows you to use more Photon Blasts.
Synergizes well with [weapons](#harmonizers) such as the Neos series that further increase Photon Blast accumulation and reduce PP consumption for some time after using a Photon Blast.

## Not Recommended

### ![wa](_static/class/UINGSClassWa.png) ![sub](_static/class/UINGSClassGu.png) Waker/Gunner
Increases active PP regen from Normal Attacks, Dodge Attacks, Counter Attacks, [Familiar Harmony](#familiar-harmony), and Dash Attacks thanks to Attack PP Recovery and Overwhelm. 
Generally, Force is the better subclass since it works during all of the above, and also passively while you're performing other actions such as [Marmelo Strike](#marmelo-strike).
PP economy is also not really an issue for Waker unless mobbing, in which case the Force subclass does much better while providing additional utilities such as PP conversion and access to Techniques.

### ![wa](_static/class/UINGSClassWa.png) ![sub](_static/class/UINGSClassRa.png) Waker/Ranger
Reduces the chance of getting afflicted by a status effect by 40% and reduces the duration of status effects applied to you by 50% thanks to Bad Condition Ward and Bad Condition Reduction respectively.
It also grants access to Rifle's Spread Shot and Grenadier skills that can passively regenerate in the background and be unloaded for quick burst damage and PP restoration.
However, utilizing these requires you to build for Ranged Potency to get the most out of the Rifle.
It is a servicable subclass but is not good enough to be worth considering over other subclass options.

### ![wa](_static/class/UINGSClassWa.png) ![sub](_static/class/UINGSClassBr.png) Waker/Braver
Lets you restore 10% HP upon breaking your fall by pressing the spacebar after getting launched or knocked back by an attack if you take the Breakfall HP Gain skill.
Also allows Restasignes to restore 30 PP with the Restasigne PP Gain skill, and increases the amount of HP restored by Restasignes by 20% thanks to Resta Effect Amplifier.
However, Waker already has its own [skills](#optional-skills) that help with HP self-sustain, and PP regen upon using a Restasigne is an unreliable way to restore PP.
All in all, Braver subclass is not recommended.

### ![wa](_static/class/UINGSClassWa.png) ![sub](_static/class/UINGSClassHu.png) Waker/Hunter
Hunter's Flash Guard allows you to take 15% less damage, and the Hunter Physique active skill can further reduce damage taken by another 25% for a short time while granting immunity to knockback and being launched.
After Hunter Physique ends, Hunter Physique Extra Shield will provide one shield during Photon Arts that will reduce the damage of one attack by 30% and prevent a knockback or launch.
Waker already has its own [skills](#optional-skills) to reduce damage taken, and also [Hot Marmelo Parry](#hot-marmelo-parry) to fully guard against an attack during a Photon Art without interrupting it while simultaneously increasing [Marmelo's Focus Gauge](#marmelo-strike). 
Therefore, the Hunter subclass is not recommended.
