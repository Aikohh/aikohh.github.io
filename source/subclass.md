# Subclasses

## Recommended

### Force
Increases natural PP regeneration, and restores PP when an enemy dies near you.
This is the best subclass for mobbing.

### Fighter
Increases damage dealt and active PP regeneration on downed enemies.
Great for bossing.

### Bouncer
Increases damage dealt to enemies that have parts broken.
Also increases the Down Factor applied to enemies.
This is also great for bossing and specific content where you need to get Downs quickly.

### Techter
Increases Photon Blast accumulation.
Great for long quests to enable using your Photon Blast for extra damage.
Synergizes well with weapons such as the Neos series.

## Not Recommended

### Gunner
Increases active PP regen from Normal Attacks, Step Attacks, Counter Attacks, [Familiar Harmony](#familiar-harmony), and Dash Attacks. Generally, Force is better since it works during all of the above, and also passively while you're performing other actions such as [Marmelo Strike](#marmelo-strike).
PP economy is also not really an issue for Waker unless mobbing, which Force subclass does much better at.

### Ranger
Reduces the chance of getting afflited by a status effect and/or reduces the duration of status effects applied to you.
It also grants access to Rifle's Spread Shot and Grenadier skills that can passively regenerate in the background and be unloaded for quick burst damage and PP restoration.
Requires you to build for Ranged Potency to get the most out of the Rifle.
It's nice but definitely not good enough to be worth considering over other subclass options.

### Braver
Lets you restore HP upon breaking your fall by pressing the spacebar after getting launched or knocked back by an attack.
Also allows Restasignes to restore PP, and increases the amount of HP restored by Restasignes.
Waker already has its own skills that help with HP self-sustain, so Braver subclass is not recommended.

### Hunter
Allows you to take even less damage, and grants access to the Hunter Physique active skill to further reduce damage and grant immunity to knockback and being launched.
Waker already has its own skills to reduce damage taken, so the Hunter subclass is not recommended.
