# Add-on Skills

Add-on Skills are permanent buffs for the player regardless of which class is being played.
However, obtaining Add-on Skills requires class-specific materials called N-Class EX-Cubes which are used at the Class Counter to generate Add-on Skills from specific classes.
Each class gives their own unique buffs which are separated into two categories: Main Effects and Sub Effects.
There is only one Main Effect per class, and it is guaranteed every time you generate an Add-on Skill from that class.
Sub Effects are randomly selected from a pool of possible effects from the given class, and is assigned a random level from 1 to 20.
The Main Effect's level monotonically increases from 1 to 20 with each Add-on Skill generation (i.e., its level can never drop).
For more information about Add-on Skills, refer to the [Arks-Visiphone](https://pso2na.arks-visiphone.com/wiki/Portal:New_Genesis/Add-on_Skills).

You should prioritize Main Effects first before the Sub Effects because Main Effects are guaranteed, monotonically increase in level, and are typically more impactful to gameplay than Sub Effects.
It can also cost a lot to get Add-on Skills to level 20, so Level 18 is considered to be a suitable stopping point.

Here is a class priority in which you should obtain and level up your Add-on Skills:

```

```{note}
If you play Melee and Ranged classes, then the Hunter and Ranger Add-on Skills should be moved closer to the top of the list to maximize their damage output.

## Encore Jump and Wulfen Demolition

Bouncer's Encore Jump Add-on Skill Sub Effect has a unique synergy with long-held [Wulfen Demolition](#wulfen-demolition) because you can deal damage with Encore Jump while charging Wulfen at the same time.

This is particularly useful against bosses like Dark Falz Aegis in solo scenarios to deal damage while controlling the amount of down you apply, since Encore Jump does not apply any down and only deals damage.
Some of Dark Falz Aegis' attacks leave places where you can spam Encore Jump repeatedly for high DPS thanks to ceilings that you can bump your head against on the parts you can attack.

```{note}
Fighter's Jump Power Up Add-on Skill Sub Effect has an anti-synergy with Encore Jump because the increased jump height decreases the number of Encore Jumps you can utilize in certain scenarios. Some players like to keep both a low level Jump Power Up and a high level Jump Power Up to be able to swap between them at the Class Counter in such cases when needed.
