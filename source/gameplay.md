# Gameplay Tips

Various Waker gameplay tips that were not explained in-depth in the [Skill Tree](#skill-tree) and [Moveset](#moveset) sections.

## Managing Treble Clef Marks

Constantly upkeeping a [Treble Clef Mark](#treble-clef-marking) on an enemy is important for three main reasons:

1. Marked enemies take 3% more damage and 20% more down from your own Harmonizer [Photon Arts](#photon-arts)

1. Igniting a mark using [Treble Clef Ignition](#treble-clef-ignition) restores a lot of PP, which makes it essential for PP management and lessens the need for PP-regeneration-focused [Subclasses](#subclass)

1. Igniting a mark with [Treble Clef Ignition](#treble-clef-ignition) summons a [Familiar Support](#familiar-support) crest, which can be amplified with [Familiar Support Amplifier](#familiar-support-amplifier) by summoning another crest while one is already active

To apply a Treble Clef Mark to an enemy, you need to build it up by attacking the same enemy multiple times.
Generally, two held [Photon Arts](#photon-arts) plus one or two [Linear Drives](#linear-drive) is enough to Mark an enemy. 
The primary exceptions are long-held [Wulfen Demolition](#wulfen-demolition) and [Familiar Harmony](#familiar-harmony) with [Familiar Harmony Marking Clef](#familiar-harmony-marking-clef), which can Mark an enemy in a single hit.

For exact Treble Clef application numbers of each attack, refer to the [Frame Data](#frame-data) spreadsheets. 

### DPS Rotation with Familiar Harmony Marking Clef

With the introduction of the skill [Familiar Harmony Marking Clef](#familiar-harmony-marking-clef), Waker's DPS has been able to reach new heights by utilizing [Familiar Harmony](#familiar-harmony) after [Treble Clef Ignition](#treble-clef-ignition) to maximize Mark uptime. This allows for the following example DPS rotation:

> 1. Short-held [Wulfen Demolition](#wulfen-demolition) if it is a stationary target, otherwise use Held [Wulfen Raid](#wulfen-raid)
> 1. Held [Wulfen Raid](#wulfen-raid). If required, repeat once to obtain 1 [Wulfen Stock](#harmonizer-focus)
> 1. Tapped [Fredran Riding](#fredran-riding). Repeat until 1 [Fredran Stock](#harmonizer-focus) is obtained
> 1. Backwards [Linear Drive](#linear-drive)
> 1. [Treble Clef Ignition](#treble-clef-ignition) (Summons a Fredran [Familiar Support](#familiar-support) crest)
> 1. [Familiar Harmony](#familiar-harmony)
> 1. Repeat from step 1

In this rotation, Wulfen is the primary damage dealer actively generating [Wulfen Focus](#harmonizer-focus) and applying [Treble Clef](#treble-clef-marking) if the enemy is not already Marked.
[Fredran Focus](#harmonizer-focus) is generated by a Fredran [Familiar Support](#familiar-support) crest and with Tapped [Fredran Riding](#fredran-riding).
This rotation will upkeep a [Treble Clef Mark](#treble-clef-marking) on an enemy while simultaneously generating [Harmonizer Focus](#harmonizer-focus) to regularly use [Familiar Harmony](#familiar-harmony). Regular usage of clef mark ignition, [Linear Drive](#linear-drive), and Familiar Harmony also upkeep the PP needed to maintain this rotation.

#### Caveats

While this is a good rotation, **Waker is not a fixed-rotation class that always repeats exactly the same sequences of actions for optimal DPS**. A Waker needs to adapt according to the situation. Some example scenarios:

- If the enemy is attacking, then you should prioritize using your Weapon Action to build up [Marmelo Strike](#marmelo-strike) and counter attack with a [Harmonizer Parry Counter](#harmonizer-parry-counter)

- If your Marmelo focus gauge is full, prioritize throwing Marmelo as soon as possible to deal massive damage and reset Marmelo's focus gauge back to zero so that you don't "waste" subsequent opportunities to charge Marmelo for extra damage

- If your Fredran focus is nearly full, you should consider making a Wulfen [Familiar Support](#familiar-support) crest instead of a Fredran crest to help generate more Wulfen Focus to use more [Familiar Harmonies](#familiar-harmony). The same thing applies vice-versa (Wulfen vs Fredran)

- While the above rotation will eventually produce a [maximally-amplified Familiar Support crest](#familiar-support-amplifier), it does not do so very quickly. You can choose to perform a [Treble Clef Ignition](#treble-clef-ignition) earlier in the rotation to get the (next level of amplified) Familiar Support crest sooner. For instance, you can skip the repeat Tapped [Fredran Riding](#fredran-riding) in step 3, perform steps 4 and 5 to obtain an early Fredran [Familiar Support](#familiar-support) crest, and then perform the repeat Tapped [Fredran Riding](#fredran-riding) before step 6 to get the 1 needed [Fredran Stock](#harmonizer-focus) with the help of the crest


## Marmelo Stacking

Against some enemy attacks that hit multiple times, you can quickly tap the Weapon Action in quick succession to build the [Marmelo Focus Gauge](#marmelo-strike) more than once.

_Guarding against two attacks in quick succession with the Weapon Action to build Marmelo's Focus Gauge from Stage 1 to Stage 2._

```{note}
This trick won't work by performing a [Hot Marmelo Parry](#hot-marmelo-parry) and then Weapon Action because Hot Marmelo Parry gives invulnerability frames after guarding an attack that will prevent the subsequent Weapon Action from guarding the next attack. 
```
