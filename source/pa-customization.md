# Tech Arts Customization

Tech Arts Customizations allow enhancing a certain aspect of a [Photon Art](#photon-arts) in exchange for some detriment such as increased PP cost. For the best value out of your resources, you should level customizations to level 5 and then work towards getting them to level 10 later.

For brevity, the customizations below will only list their stats at the maximum level.

## Fredran Riding

Each of [Fredran Riding](#fredran-riding)'s customizations are useful in different situations, with each one changing its usage in very distinct ways.

### Type 1

- Increases Lunge Potency based on time spent on Fredran
- Stage 1 Potency +80%/Stage 2 +240%
- PP Cost +5%

Adds 2 charge levels to held [Fredran Riding](#fredran-riding).
The first charge level (Stage 1) increases potency by 80%, while the second charge level (Stage 2) increases potency by 240%.
There is still a no charge level that does normal damage if you do not ride Fredran long enough to reach the first charge level.

This is a great option if you are engaging in fights that give you plenty of downtime to charge Fredran Riding, as even Stage 1 is higher damage than a fully charged [Wulfen Demolition](#wulfen-demolition).

### Type 2

- Fire vacuum wave attacks while riding Fredran
- Reduced ongoing PP Cost while riding Fredran & Charge Potency
- PP Cost on PA activation +5%

While riding Fredran, Fredran will shoot projectiles at whatever enemy you are locked onto.
These projectiles generate [Fredran focus](#harmonizer-focus) and [Treble Clef](#treble-clef).
If you can land 6+ hits, [held Fredran Riding](#held-fredran-riding) exceeds [held Wulfen Raid](#held-wulfen-raid) in DPS.
However, this is difficult to do since the projectiles tend to miss against mobile targets, and you would have to ride Fredran for a significant amount of time.

### Type 3

- Add Treble Clef Mark effet to non-Variant attacks
- PP Cost +5%

This customization allows [tapped Fredran Riding](#tapped-fredran-riding) to generate [Treble Clef](#treble-clef-marking) at much greater amounts, which is amazing for fast and aggressive bosses such as Ikusa Bujin where fitting in held PAs from either Fredran or Wulfen can be difficult. With this customization, 5 tapped Fredran Ridings are enough to create a Treble Clef mark on an enemy.

Notably, one full [held Wulfen Raid](#held-wulfen-raid) or [held Fredran Riding](#held-fredran-riding) followed by one [tapped Fredran Riding](#tapped-fredran-riding) and [backwards Linear Drive](#linear-drive) is also enough to create a [Treble Clef mark](#treble-clef-marking) on an enemy.

## Wulfen Raid

Each of [Wulfen Raid](#wulfen-raid)'s customizations are useful in different situations. There is no one "best" customization for every situation.
However, if you were to only choose one, **Type 1 is the customization I would recommend to most players most of the time** due to its jack-of-all-trades nature, and the one to prioritize leveling to 10 due to the combination of attack speed and PP cost increase causing a noticable effect on PP consumption over time.

### Type 1

- Increase Attack Speed (~15%)
- PA Potency -12%
- PP Cost +5%

With this customization the DPS of Wulfen Raid gets a small increase (~2%) in both its tapped and held variants, but the amount of [Treble Clef](#treble-clef-marking), physical down, Photon Blast gauge accumulation, and [Wulfen focus](#harmonizer-focus) per second get a nice bump (~15%) thanks to the increased attack speed.

### Type 2

- Focus Gauge Accumulation +50%
- PP Cost +5%

This customization a good option if you find yourself lacking Wulfen focus in certain encounters. Examples of such encounters could those where Fredran is used more often (such as versus bosses that have 3+ parts for you to abuse held Fredran Breath for more DPS over Wulfen Raid) or otherwise have low uptime on Wulfen PA usage.

### Type 3

- Add Treble Clef Mark effect to non-Variant Attacks
- PP Cost +5%

This customization allows [tapped Wulfen Raid](#tapped-wulfen-raid) to generate [Treble Clef](#treble-clef-marking) at much greater amounts, which is amazing for fast and aggressive bosses such as Ikusa Bujin where fitting in held PAs from either Fredran or Wulfen can be difficult. With this customization, 2 tapped Wulfen Raids are enough to create a [Treble Clef mark](#treble-clef-marking) on an enemy.
