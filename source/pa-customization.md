# Tech Arts Customization

Tech Arts Customizations allow enhancing a certain aspect of a [Photon Art](#photon-arts) usually in exchange for increased PP cost and/or decreased potency.

It is to be noted that customization levels only affect the PP cost, with higher levels decreasing the increased PP cost to a measily 5% at the maximum level of 10.
Since Waker has an abundance of PP regeneration thanks to [Treble Clef Ingition](#treble-clef-ignition), [Familiar Harmony](#familiar-harmony), and [counter attacks](#counters) the increased PP costs of customizations are mostly negligible especially at maximum level. 
For the best value out of your resources, you may consider leveling each customization to level 5 to start with (for 10% increased PP cost), and then work towards getting them to level 10 later.

The customizations below will only list their stats at the maximum level. Lower levels will just have higher PP costs (20% at level 1).

## Wulfen Raid

Each of [Wulfen Raid](#wulfen-raid)'s customizations are useful in different situations. There is no one "best" customization for every situation.

### Type 1

- Increase Attack Speed
- PA Potency -12%
- PP Cost +5%

This customization increases the animation speed of Wulfen Raid but lowers the potency.
The damage-per-second of Wulfen Raid remains the same, but the amount of [Treble Clef](#treble-clef-marking), down, and [focus](#harmonizer-focus) per second get a nice bump thanks to the increased attack speed.

### Type 2

- Focus Gauge Accumulation +50%
- PP Cost +5%

Increases Wulfen focus gauge accumulation by 50%.
This is a good option if you find yourself lacking Wulfen focus a lot in certain encounters where Fredran is used more often.

### Type 3

- Add Treble Clef Mark effect to non-Variant Attacks
- PP Cost +5%

This customization allows [tapped Wulfen Raid](#tapped-wulfen-raid) to generate [Treble Clef](#treble-clef-marking) at much greater amounts.
This enables new combos for creating Treble Clef marks quickly, such as using 3 tapped Wulfen Raids in succession to create one Treble Clef mark.

One combo in particular (thanks to theuberclips on Discord) can be used to generate and ignite a Treble Clef mark very fast.
This combo utilizes dodge-cancelled [held Wulfen Raid](held-wulfen-raid) (to skip the final kick) and [dodge attacks](#dodge-attack) to create a Treble Clef mark and immediately ignite it:

1. [Held Wulfen Raid](held-wulfen-raid) until after the spin attack
1. Dodge to cancel the final kick
1. [Held Wulfen Raid](held-wulfen-raid) until after the spin attack
1. [Dodge attack](#dodge-attack) to cancel the final kick and keep holding the normal attack button to perform a [Treble Clef Ignition](#treble-clef-ignition)
