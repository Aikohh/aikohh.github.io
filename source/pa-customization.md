# Tech Arts Customization

Tech Arts Customizations allow enhancing a certain aspect of a [Photon Art](#photon-arts) in exchange for some detriment such as increased PP cost. For the best value out of your resources, you should level customizations to level 5 and then work towards getting them to level 10 later.

For brevity, the customizations below will only list their stats at the maximum level.

## Wulfen Raid

Each of [Wulfen Raid](#wulfen-raid)'s customizations are useful in different situations. There is no one "best" customization for every situation.

### Type 1

- Increase Attack Speed (~15%)
- PA Potency -12%
- PP Cost +5%

With this customization the DPS of Wulfen Raid gets a small increase (~2%) in both its tapped and held variants, but the amount of [Treble Clef](#treble-clef-marking), physical down, Photon Blast gauge accumulation, and [Wulfen focus](#harmonizer-focus) per second get a nice bump (~15%) thanks to the increased attack speed.

In general, **this is the customization I would recommend to most players most of the time** due to its jack-of-all-trades nature, and the one to prioritize leveling to 10 due to the combination of attack speed and PP cost increase causing a noticable effect on PP consumption over time.

### Type 2

- Focus Gauge Accumulation +50%
- PP Cost +5%

This customization a good option if you find yourself lacking Wulfen focus in certain encounters. Examples of such encounters could those where Fredran is used more often (such as versus bosses that have 3+ parts for you to abuse held Fredran Breath for more DPS over Wulfen Raid) or otherwise have low uptime on Wulfen PA usage.

### Type 3

- Add Treble Clef Mark effect to non-Variant Attacks
- PP Cost +5%

This customization allows [tapped Wulfen Raid](#tapped-wulfen-raid) to generate [Treble Clef](#treble-clef-marking) at much greater amounts, which is amazing for fast and aggressive bosses such as Ikusa Bujin where fitting in held PAs from either Fredran or Wulfen can be difficult. With this customization, 3 tapped Wulfen Raids is enough to create a Treble Clef mark on an enemy.

Notably, because a full held Wulfen Raid starts with the first half of a tapped Wulfen Raid, a held Wulfen Raid also gains a small bump in Treble Clef generation. This fact enables a very fast combo (mentioned by theuberclips on Discord) for creating and igniting a Treble Clef mark.
The combo utilizes dodge-cancelled [held Wulfen Raids](held-wulfen-raid) and [dodge attacks](#dodge-attack) to create a Treble Clef mark and immediately ignite it:

1. [Held Wulfen Raid](held-wulfen-raid) until after the spin attack
1. Dodge to cancel the final kick
1. [Held Wulfen Raid](held-wulfen-raid) until after the spin attack
1. [Dodge attack](#dodge-attack) to cancel the final kick and keep holding the normal attack button to perform a [Treble Clef Ignition](#treble-clef-ignition)
