# Introduction

_Waker_ uses a [Harmonizer](#harmonizers) to summon photonic beings called _Familiars_ to attack foes or defend against incoming attacks.
Waker currently has three different Familiars: 
_Fredran_, a ranged attacker that is effective for dealing with enemies at all distances; 
_Wulfen_, a melee fighter that can unleash powerful strikes at close range; 
and _Marmelo_, a defender and counter-attacker that can block incoming attacks and deal back massive damage when thrown. 

To play Waker effectively, you need to master the use of your Familiars and their [Photon Arts](#photon-arts). 
It requires balancing the [Focus Gauges](#harmonizer-focus) of each Familiar and utilizing other [class skills](#core-skills) depending on the situation.

But first, you need to put points into your [Skill Tree](#skill-tree)!
