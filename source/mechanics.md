# Class Mechanics

## Familiar Focus Gauge

A red bar (Wulfen) and a blue bar (Fredran).
Increase them by using their respective Photon Arts (PAs).

## Familiar Harmony

When you have at least one full red and blue bar, you can use Familiar Harmony to have the Familiars make a big boom for big damage in a large cone-shaped area of effect (AoE) in front of you.

## Treble Clef

After hitting the same target enough times, a shiny white marker called a Treble Clef appears on them.
This marker increases both the damage dealt by PAs and physical and elemental down applied by them.
You can ignite a Treble Clef by holding down the normal attack button, which will summon a Familiar Support which periodically inflicts a small amount of damage that increases a Familiar's focus gauge.
Which Familiar focus gauge is increased depends on the color of the Familiar Support, which is determined by the last PA you used before igniting the Treble Clef.

## Marmelo

Using the weapon action (WA) brings out Marmelo to guard an instance of damage for you.
Guard up to 3 attacks to make Marmelo stupidly fat.
You can throw Marmelo by holding down and then letting go of the WA.
Doing so deals damage based on how fat Marmelo is - the fatter Marmelo is, the more damage will be dealt.
Marmelo becomes smol again after being thrown.
