<!-- _Knowing your enemies attack patterns is only half the battle. You must also learn to adapt to these patterns and execute accordingly._ -->

_Waker_ uses a [Harmonizer](#harmonizers) to summon photonic beings called _Familiars_ to attack foes or defend against incoming attacks.
Waker currently has three different Familiars: 
_Fredran_, a ranged attacker that is effective for dealing with enemies at all distances; 
_Wulfen_, a melee fighter that can unleash powerful strikes at close range; 
and _Marmelo_, a defender and counter-attacker that can block incoming attacks and deal back massive damage when thrown. 

To play Waker effectively, you need to master the use of your Familiars and their [Photon Arts](#photon-arts). 
It requires balancing the [Focus Gauges](#harmonizer-focus) of each Familiar and utilizing other [class skills](#core-skills) depending on the situation.

One strength of Waker is its versatility. It performs well in any situation you can throw at it, thanks to its variety of Familiars and skills, while also having the greatest mobility out of all the other classes!
However, it is also one of the most complex and difficult classes to master due to the sheer number of mechanics involved and the unforgiving animation locks on nearly every action.

Waker is also one of the highest actions-per-minute (APM) classes in the game, requiring many fast button presses to play optimally especially against aggressive enemies like Ikusa Bujin (found in Geometric Labyrinth). Not only that, but every action has to be carefully timed (again, due to unforgiving animation locks).

But don't let the difficulty curve discourage you from trying out this awesome class!
It feels very satisfying and quite rewarding when you get a feel for the class and have that "aha!" moment when you figure out optimal combos for each encounter.
When played well, Waker competes with the likes of the other classes while being a lot more engaging than pressing the same few buttons over and over again.

This guide was written to document what Waker does and how to play it effectively.  
Go on to the [Skill Tree](#skill-tree) section if you wish to learn more about Waker!
