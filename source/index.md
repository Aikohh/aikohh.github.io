# Aikoh's Waker Guide! 

Welcome to Aikoh's comprehensive Waker guide!

Waker is a versatile class that performs well in any situation you can throw at it, thanks to its variety of Familiars and skills.
However, it is also one of the most complex and difficult classes to master due to the sheer number of mechanics involved and the unforgiving animation locks on nearly every action.

Waker is also one of the highest actions-per-minute (APM) classes in the game, requiring many fast button presses to play optimally especially against aggressive enemies like Ikusa Bujin (found in Geometric Labyrinth). Not only that, but every action has to be carefully timed (again, due to unforgiving animation locks).

_Knowing your enemies attack patterns is only half the battle. You must also learn to adapt to these patterns and execute accordingly._

Don't let the difficulty curve discourage you from trying out this awesome class!
It feels very satisfying and quite rewarding when you get a feel for the class and have that "aha!" moment when you figure out optimal combos for each encounter.
When played well, Waker competes with the likes of the other classes while being a lot more engaging than pressing the same few buttons over and over again.

This guide was written to document what Waker does and how to play it effectively.
